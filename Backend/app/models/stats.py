NOTE ABOUT STATS

Statistics rely on 2 database tables: user and visitor stats, and the analytics of this content is shown to admin only.

Statistics to analyse site visitors and users to understand base group geolocation, devices used, and referrer sites are important for admins to adapt their content and measure the reach and success of their apps. At the same time, respecting user's privacy and data is very important.

No third-party analytics solution was used to make sure users' behaviour is not monitored or tracked.
The stats module aims to offer enough information for analysis while not storing information that can be used to distinguish or trace the individual's identity.

What is measured:
- General geographical location (why? example: to determine where your server should be located)
- Size of the device used (why? example: to decide whether to invest more in usability for mobile devices)
- Referrer site (why? example: to understand if your ad campaign is working)
- Unique visitors (why? example: to understand if your reach is growing)
- Registration (signups)/ Deregistration (account deletion) (why? example: measure conversion or churn rate)

How is it measured:
The most precise would be to use geolocation - that needs user's express permission and many are scared to give it.
The two other options are cookies and ip addresses:
- Cookies have received a bad reputation as many in the web used them to track online behaviour accross sites and gather personal information - which lead to users often blocking or deleting them.  
- IP addresses may suffer from the lack of accuracy, and will likely not yield the exact location (especially when in a public network or using VPNs). 
Balacing pros and cons, the decision was to use IP addresses (especially due to simplicity) to provide insights on geolocation and unique visitors. Admins should keep in mind the data will not be the most accurate (not only regarding geolocation, but also unique visitors, since two visitors using the same IP address may be counted as 1, added to the fact only anonymized IPs are stored - which reduces accuracy further). All in all, there is no perfect solution, but the data collected should yield a decent base for analysis.
